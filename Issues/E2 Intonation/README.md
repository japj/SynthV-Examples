# E2 Intonation comparison Asterian / Saros

While working on a SATB choral piece I discovered something weird with the intonation of the lower notes, e.g. C2.

Astarian (bass) does not seem to have the correct (default) intonation,
the weird thing is that Saros (tenor) does seem to have correct intonation.
